# 🏡 Airbnb Clone Project

A comprehensive, real-world web application designed to simulate the development of a robust booking platform similar to Airbnb. This project serves as a deep dive into full-stack development, focusing on backend systems, database design, GraphQL APIs, and application security.

## 🚀 Project Goals

* Build a scalable and secure backend booking platform.
* Design a relational database schema reflecting real-world use cases.
* Develop GraphQL APIs using Django and MySQL.
* Collaborate effectively using GitHub and CI/CD pipelines.
* Apply modern software engineering best practices.

## 🧰 Tech Stack

* **Backend Framework**: Django
* **Database**: MySQL
* **API Layer**: GraphQL (Graphene-Django)
* **Version Control**: Git + GitHub
* **CI/CD Tools**: GitHub Actions / Docker (optional)

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By completing this project, learners will:

* Master team collaboration workflows using GitHub.
* Deepen understanding of backend architecture and relational databases.
* Design secure GraphQL APIs and implement authentication/authorization.
* Set up CI/CD pipelines for efficient and automated deployments.
* Enhance documentation and project planning skills.
* Integrate Django, MySQL, and GraphQL into a unified, full-stack application.

## ✅ Requirements

To participate, learners should:

* Have a GitHub account and understand Git workflows.
* Be familiar with Django and MySQL basics.
* Understand core software development lifecycle (SDLC) principles.
* Know how to use Docker and GitHub Actions (or similar CI/CD tools).
* Be comfortable with writing in Markdown.

## 🔑 Key Highlights

* **Project Repository Management**: Setup and structure GitHub repos like industry professionals.
* **Team Documentation**: Define and assign roles for clear collaboration.
* **Database Design**: Model entities like users, listings, bookings, and reviews with realistic relationships.
* **Feature-Driven Development**: Implement core features like listing creation, booking, user authentication, and search filters.
* **GraphQL API Development**: Use Graphene to build flexible, secure endpoints.
* **Security Best Practices**: Implement JWT, CSRF protection, and input validation.
* **CI/CD Integration**: Automate builds, tests, and deployments using modern tools.
